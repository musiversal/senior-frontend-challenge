=== musiversal mini-DAW ===

Description:

We want to build a tool that put us closer on our mission of making anybody a music creator. That is why we are going to create a very simple DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).

The designs and a bit of the interaction of what this DAW will include is in the following figma:

This tool will allow the user to drag and drop samples into a track, and play to hear how it sounds.
The basic samples are stored in the folder "samples". Some images are included in "images". You can rename the folders or structure the project in whatever way you want.

Features:
* Samples can be played and stopped by pressing the button.
* Saved tracks can be  played and stopped by pressing a button.
* Tracks will play whatever they have in the track.
* Users should be able to save tracks. If the user refresh the screen, he should see old saved tracks.
* You can edit the name of the track, by clicking on the track name (above the Save button).
* When dragging a sample to the track, a user will be able to place it in the right place (second), displaying it. See slide 3, it will mean when a user presses play, we will have 20 seconds of silence and then Sample Two will sound). A user should be able to drop the sample anywhere within the track. You can define a max size of the track of 1 minute, for example, if this simplifies the task.
* When pressing play, it will always start from the beginning of the track, until it is stopped, allowing silences between samples added to the track.

Additional requirements:
* You should use ReactJS
* We need a README.md with launch/setup instructions, any technical choices you have made (which ones and why), additional features you added, known bugs or features that you would have add into the DAW.
* Upload the code into a github/gitlab repo.
* Some basic knowledge on unit tests is required. It doesn't mean you everything has to be tested, but we want to know you know your way around tests.
* You can use any open source libraries as long as you specify why in the readme.
* If you have any additional question please send us an email.
